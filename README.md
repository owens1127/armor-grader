This is a java program that is 99% functional. It allows Destiny 2 players to grade their armor using large data-sets and a prediction engine. 

In Destiny 2, armor has 6 different stats that are comprised of 4 plugs. You can analyze these plugs and a player's desired stats to arrive at a "grade".

The project was originally going to be more in depth, but this is the extent to which it was created.

To use, run the executable file and input the stats in the drop downs.
